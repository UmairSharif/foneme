Hi fellow developer.

This folder contains cert request, certificate and private key for voip push.
This set was created specifically for use with OneSignal.com. Once logged into their dashboard go to Settings and under Native platforms find Apple iOS.
When you click on edit for this section you'll see option to change optional sandbox certificate. There you can .p12 file from this folder.
